# -Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The project is titled **"Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection"** and was presented by Arwin Kumar Ravi and his team. The key objectives of the project are:

- Identifying the risks associated with credit card transactions.
- Predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent using machine learning algorithms such as decision tree classifiers and logistic regression.
  
Key techniques and methods used:
- **Data exploration and visualization**, including identifying outliers using the IQR method.
- **Machine learning models**: 
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 99.2% on the training dataset and 98.8% on the test dataset.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of 96% on both the training and test datasets.
